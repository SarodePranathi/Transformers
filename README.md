# Transformers
This repository demonstrates a wide range of Natural Language Processing (NLP) tasks using the Hugging Face Transformers library. The notebook is designed as an interactive introduction and practical toolkit for modern NLP, showcasing how powerful transformer-based models can be applied to real-world text data.

# Features
The notebook covers the following core NLP tasks:

Sentiment Analysis:
Automatically detect whether a piece of text expresses a positive, negative, or neutral sentiment using pre-trained transformer models. This is useful for analyzing reviews, social media, feedback, and more.

Text Generation:
Generate coherent and contextually relevant text given a prompt. This can be used for content creation, blog post generation, creative writing, and more. The notebook demonstrates using models like GPT-2 for generating longer passages of text based on a seed sentence.

Named Entity Recognition (NER):
Identify and classify key information (entities) in text, such as names of people, organizations, locations, dates, etc. NER is essential for information extraction and data mining from unstructured text.

Fill-Mask (Masked Language Modeling):
Predict missing words in a sentence using models like BERT. This is useful for understanding language context, autocomplete features, and testing model comprehension.

Text Classification:
Categorize text into predefined classes or topics, such as spam detection, topic labeling, or intent classification.

Other Tasks:
The notebook may also include examples of translation, summarization, and question answering, depending on the version.
